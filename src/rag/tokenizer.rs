// This module contains tokenization functionality for the RAG system
// Currently, tokenization is handled directly in the main rag.rs file
// This module is kept for future tokenization enhancements

// Not much to see here yet, but this is where we can add tokenization-related functionality

// Placeholder for future tokenization improvements
// The main tokenization logic is currently embedded in RagSystem methods
// When advanced tokenization features are needed, they can be implemented here
