// This module contains search-related functionality for the RAG system
// Currently, the main search logic is implemented in the search_local method
// in the main rag.rs file, so this module is kept minimal for future extensions

// Not much to see here yet, but this is where we can add search-related functionality

use crate::rag::RagSystem;

// Placeholder for future search enhancements
// The main search functionality is currently in RagSystem::search_local()
impl RagSystem {
    // Future search improvements could be added here
}
