Imagine that you are trying to get people to attend an exciting workshop for data science. You begin by sending out an email to the department chairs in Allegheny College to ask them to tell students who are working with data in senior thesis projects or research projects to attend the workshop. Please write a welcoming email to the chairs to advertise the workshop including the below details.

 The workshop will be put on my the Illustrious DataGators Allegheny College and has been designed to help students get started in working with data, making plots, using models and completing similar aspects of a typical data science project. The workshop is on Monday evening at 5pm to 6:15pm on the 24th and 31st March. The programming language is R. The workshop is fun, important for career development and can be a resource to students who would like some help. The Illustrious DataGators also hold office hours to meet with students about projects. All details for workshop and the office hours may be found at the DataGators Project website; https://data-gators.com/events/.
